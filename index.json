It is a season that will forever be engraved in the history books with Max Verstappen hoping for his first championship and Lewis intending to break his shared record with Michael Schumacher.\nA rule change was brought and pre-season testing was here but Mercedes and Aston Martin were nowhere in pace compared to Red Bull and some other teams. That is the beginning of the wild ride that was the 2021 F1 season.\nRound 1 (Bahrain) came and as expected Red Bull was the fastest team but crucially Mercedes had clawed back some pace. Max struck the first blow by taking pole with Lewis right next to him. The lights went out, Mazepin did not see Turn 4, Mick struggled and Pierre was a little too close to Ricciardo. Towards the end, Max was right behind Lewis who was on ageing tyres. He went for the move outside Turn 4 and sadly for him, finished the overtake off the track. He had to give the position back and that is how he lost the win. Imola soon came with Lewis on pole and Max in P3 but by Tamburello chicane, Max was ahead. They pushed each other and when it came to lapping other drivers, Lewis slid off the track into the gravel. He managed to reverse back onto the track but was now down in P9 and a lap down. After a red flag caused by his teammate, Bottas, and Mercedes junior George Russell, Lewis was right back on the lead lap and fought to finish P2 with Max taking the win. The next couple of rounds showed the two were a class above the rest of the field and the championship was going to be tight. Monaco swang in the favour of Red Bull with Lewis being off the pace the whole weekend finishing P7 while Max took the win. Baku saw a tyre failure for Max from the lead and Lewis ended his run of consecutive points finishes after he went straight down Turn 1 on race restart. Questions were asked on whether the pressure had got to him. We got to France and Red Bull took a page out of Mercedes’ Barcelona strategy masterclass earlier in the year giving Max the win with Perez in P3 while the Silver Arrows had to settle for P2 and P4 with Lewis and Bottas respectively. After Austria and Styria, Mercedes were set to finally bring an upgrade to their car in Silverstone hoping for a good show in front of Hamilton’s home fans. This brought them ahead of Red Bull and from the first Sprint on Saturday, it was clear Lewis had the pace. In the race, Max had a good start but Lewis was right there and at Woodcote, he chose a wider line to get early on the throttle for the run to Corpse corner. This paid off and he was soon wheel to wheel with Max and that is when we had our first major collision. Max was sent into the barrier at an alarming speed but luckily he was okay. Lewis was predominantly at fault which got him a penalty that he served and hunted the other drivers to eventually win. The gap in the championship had been greatly reduced.\nHungary came and Bottas chose to switch from F1 to Bowling taking out a couple of cars by Turn 1. Max dropped back with a damaged car and Lewis somehow found himself in last place after he was the only car on the grid for the race restart. He charged on until he got to Alonso whose herculean defence skills for about 10 laps cost Hamilton some time. Ocon won thanks to avoiding the earlier crash, defending against Vettel who later got disqualified after the race and crucially Alonso\u0026rsquo;s defence. Lewis got P2 with Max down in P9.\nCredit: Alexandre Brondino\nSpa Francorchamps gave to us the shortest race in F1 history where Max’s pole gave him the win and Lewis took third place but the star of the weekend was George Russell. Lando, too, would have been right up there were it not for a red flag that was a crash too late.\nThe Dutch fans came in their masses to witness their hero Verstappen. With an impressive track that would sadly be difficult to overtake, qualifying would be crucial. Max drove himself to pole position and come to the end of the Grand Prix, the orange smoke that quite possibly covered the entire country would tell who had won it. Another Sprint weekend was upon us in the shape of the Monza circuit. Hamilton would start the Grand Prix in fourth place but soon he was batting Max who later on had a slow pit stop. Hamilton made his stop from the lead and came out right ahead of Max before he found him on top of him - Red Bull gives you wings.\nVerstappen was deemed to be at fault and he got a grid drop for the next race. With that in mind, Red Bull opted to change his engine and start from the back, Lando had a thrilling battle with the 7-time world champ but sadly lost his maiden win by not pitting for wet weather tyres. Lewis won and somehow Max was on the podium. Credit: Shem Maore\nLewis and Mercedes cocked up their strategy in Turkey while Red Bull and Max dominated the US Grand Prix which has always been in favour of Mercedes in the past. The high altitude of Mexico yet again allowed Max to win in a commanding style with Lewis defending against Perez for second place. We came to Brazil which was a huge part of this theatrical season. Lewis took a new engine but had a 5 place grid penalty for that, he got a commanding pole position but the drama started post-qualifying. Lewis was disqualified because of the gap on the Mercedes\u0026rsquo; rear wing exceeding the limit, Max got a fine for touching his wing that he hopes the stewards enjoyed a nice dinner and the Saturday sprint came. In a third of the race distance, Lewis had a masterclass performance and got himself from P20 to P5. What would this man do with a whole race distance? By lap 5, he got from P10 to P3. The fight was on, Perez was soon dispatched and only Max stood in his way. Some questionable defence was seen but Lewis recollected himself and took the win in what is considered one of his best race weekends. MotoGP gave way to F1 on their track in Qatar and Lewis continued with his Brazil form, Max drove through to finish second. Saudi Arabia was atrocious in track safety and how the FIA (with Michael Masi) conducted themselves but the talk was about the collision between the title contenders. Max was told to give the position back to Lewis who ended up running into his back. Controversy aside, Lewis won the race and equalled his rival in points going into the final race. Before the final race, it was evident Max has been consistent all through the year while Lewis has always managed to climb back. It seemed we were back to the first race with the tie and it was going to be the winner takes it all in Abu Dhabi.\nMax threw the first punch by taking pole from Lewis who rather looked very spirited for someone who had lost pole. The final \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s lights out and away we go\u0026rdquo; and Lewis immediately took the lead, Max tried to get through while Hamilton had to resort to using the runoff. In the lead, he created a good gap, pitted to mirror Red Bull\u0026rsquo;s strategy and Perez defended beautifully to get Max closer to Lewis. Red Bull changed strategy and pitted with a few laps to go. It all seemed like Max would not reduce the gap any further until Nicholas Latifi binned it in the hotel section. Max pitted once again under the safety car and cue in the controversy. Race Control notified that lapped car would not overtake, quickly changed on that, just the five lapped cars between Lewis and Max were let through and quickly the safety car period was ended. One more lap of racing to define it all and Lewis tried his best but Max with the fresher tyres overtook him to win the 2021 World Drivers Championship.\nAs of writing, the driver\u0026rsquo;s championship is not set in stone but coming to the last race, we were all prepared for whatever outcome and whoever got it definitely deserved it. It is clear though that the FIA need to be consistent and dare I say, Michael Masi needs to resign - his work is tough but if he does not improve on some things then maybe we need to try someone else.\nAll in all, 2021 was a great season for Formula 1 and will be remembered as one of the greatest. Bye 2021, it has been a pleasure.\n","date":"12 December 2021","permalink":"/f1-2021-greatest-formula-1-season/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAfter a tumultuous year that was 2020, Formula 1 came into what many would call the best season in recent years.

The prospects and the idea of the new offroad Rallycross-like racing series with electric SUVs were and are very exciting.\nAlong with this excitement from that, came names like Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg, Jenson Button, Sebastian Loeb to the reigning World RX champion Johan Kristoffersson. 2021 would be an exciting year for all rally fans and motorsports fans who wanted to get into some dirty action.\nSoon questions about the race format, \u0026ldquo;the gimmicks\u0026rdquo; (Gridplay - similar to Formula E\u0026rsquo;s fanboost where fans vote to give their favourite driver extra power for a certain time, this makes it seem like a popularity contest) and other criticisms arose.\nOdyssey 21 during testing Saturday, 3rd April came and we were pumped for the start of the inaugural season of XE. Being the first race weekend, the Qualifying run order was set randomly and the gender-balanced team of drivers set out to fight it out and get a decent lap time on the board, to say the least.\nBoy oh boy, was the first qualifying session (Q1) exciting. The benchmark was set by the duo of Sebastian Loeb and Christina Gutierrez, Catie Munnings had a spectacular drive after she got a puncture managing to control the car ( Odyssey 21) to the finish line, the roll by Sarrazin that got us shaking, the pure pace of the duo of Johan Kristofferson and more so Molly Taylor to the shocking roll of Claudia Hurtgen.\nThe second qualifying session (Q2) was less dramatic and this brought to light some issues the XE broadcast team need to fix. We missed Molly Taylor\u0026rsquo;s lap because they opted to show us highlights of the prior runs despite her being the Q1 star. Fans were also confused if the times from Q1 would be added to that of Q2 and if so why was the timing sheet not including the aggregated time. It also became clear that the sessions were not really live but this is understandable since the race locations are in remote places but the execution had much to desire.\nIt was evident that during the race, whose format was very confusing, the first few metres would matter a lot due to the Desert X Prix being sandy and the Odyssey 21 kicking it up in the air. The assumptions came true when during the semi-final, the cars behind the lead driver struggled with vision and were soon running over 30 seconds behind. During another race session, the blindness in driving caused a massive crash and all this left fans rather underwhelmed.\nBeing a series that wishes to have some wheel-to-wheel racing, this was a very boring start (to the race part - not qualifying) but only a start it was. The next couple of locations seem exciting on paper and XE Twitter quickly pointed this out. It seems that only the Arctic X Prix will have a similar scenario to that we experienced this weekend but with snow instead.\nDespite sounding negative throughout this piece, this was just the first race in an inaugural season, Extreme E can and should only have an upward trajectory from here. Improve their onscreen graphics, iron out broadcasting issues and resolve the other issues, that will make us hardcore and casual motorsport fans loyal to the racing series.\nYou can watch this video for a brief introduction to the series:\nTill next time, you can find me on Twitter, peace.\n","date":"5 April 2021","permalink":"/the-dilemma-from-extreme-es-first-race-weekend/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFrom the ashes, Alejandro Agag brought to us Extreme E (XE) after starting Formula E few years back.

The points stand at 334-317 in favour of Hamilton against Rosberg.\nWith the normal system, the 17-point-lead Hamilton has would mean he would need a minimum of 6th place finish to secure the title.\nCredit: Nick Fewings\nThe new double points system by Bernie Ecclestone meant that this advantage was reduced and Hamilton needed at least P2 in the race. Rosberg was pumped up for his chances and anything was possible with how Formula One can be brutal. Mercedes on the other hand felt they needed to ensure this title fight is equal and the cars are reliable.\nThe double points meant that each point would essentially be equivalent to two races in that position. The normal point system is 25–18–15–12–10–8–6–4–2–1 with huge gaps being within the top 3 positions. This gap would be even larger due to the new system and that meant every driver had to be at their best.\nComing into the weekend, Rosberg was in form from clinching the Brazilian GP race win and having started to reduce the gap in the championship that he led multiple times in the year. On Saturday, Rosberg did all he could to take pole position while Hamilton had to settle for P2 on the grid. This was shaping up to be a great title fight with all to play for unlike any of the recent times.\nSunday came and soon the drivers lined up on the grid for a thriller ahead of them. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s lights out and away we go\u0026rdquo; and Hamilton shot up into the lead by turn 1 leaving Rosberg behind challenged by a Williams but he held onto P2.\nThe first pit stop rounds came and Mercedes called in Hamilton shortly followed by his teammate retaining their positions on track with Rosberg being about 2.5 seconds behind. A few lockups later and it seemed Rosberg was not having fun out there. This was shortly followed by him coming on the radio to report he was losing power. The team confirmed to him from the telemetry they had that his ERS (Energy Recovery System) had failed, this basically meant he would be down on about 160 HP. To add insult to injury, he was also having temperature issues with his rear brakes.\nHamilton was cruising in front stretching the gap to over 7 seconds to Rosberg who was having a diagnosis dialog with his race engineer over the radio. The Williams of Felipe Massa was also hounding him from the back and he soon dropped to P3. A few laps later, he wanted to settle for at least a top 6 finish. Second rounds of pits came, Hamilton and a couple of laps later his teammate followed into the pits but with no turbo, it would be difficult for him to pull from his pit box leading to Daniel Ricciardo overtaking him during this period.\nAt this moment, all he could do was drive flat out, try to stay in the top 6 and hope Hamilton retires from the race. His woes were far from over, he soon dropped out of point scoring position.\nMeanwhile, out in the lead, Felipe Massa was slowly but surely reducing the gap to Hamilton and it all seemed like he was suffering the same fate as his teammate. The team questioned this but it became clear that Lewis was driving intentionally slower to try and prevent the same scenario befalling him.\nWith Rosberg in P14 and experiencing every sort of problem you can imagine, his team instructed him to pit to retire the car but he requested to be allowed to finish the race. This was showing his world class champions mentality and the team granted his wish as it was the last race. Soon he was about to be lapped by Hamilton and with a few laps to go, Lewis started to up his pace.\nThe chequered flag was waved for Hamilton securing his 2nd World Championship and the first driver\u0026rsquo;s title for Mercedes since 1955. Despite Rosberg losing horribly, with the stellar start Hamilton had, it all shifted in Hamilton\u0026rsquo;s favour and Rosberg was the first to acknowledge this. He later went on to congratulate Lewis in the cool down room and hoped to bring the fight to him again the next year.\nAll in all, the double point system meant Hamilton walked away with 384 points and Rosberg retained 317. The new system did not matter in the title fight and most, including both contenders, labelled it as \u0026lsquo;artificial\u0026rsquo;.\nVSC (Virtual Safety Car) was the only experiment from the last few races of the season that was retained and the new double points system was scrapped altogether never to be tried again.\nTill next time, find me on Twitter.

Let\u0026rsquo;s continue where we left off.\nRules and Regulations # The obvious: no crashing into another driver, stick to the track limits, no going backwards and any other insanity you can probably think of. No illegal blocking of another driver, when defending you are permitted to move just once. You can\u0026rsquo;t zig-zag around. During a dry race, a driver must use two different tyre compounds (more on that later) therefore they must pit. Slow down to the speed limit in the pit lane (80 kph for most tracks). Always leave a car width of space to the driver you are fighting - essentially don\u0026rsquo;t squeeze them off track. Those are the common ones but the commentators will fill you in when something happens. When a crash or something happens that requires marshals or a recovery vehicle on track then a safety car (SC) or a virtual safety car (VSC) can be called out. For the SC, the drivers should follow behind the car and not overtake (unless told to) whereas for the VSC, the drivers follow a set lap time effectively this maintains the order and gap between the drivers.\nTyre Compounds # Source: Pirreli\nClick here for video showcasing the tyre compounds (and naming) as from 2019\nThere are two types of tyres: dry (slicks) and wet tyres (grooved). For dry tyres there are three compounds:\nSoft (red walled) - the stickiest compound thus the fastest but does not last long Medium (yellow walled) - middle of the road Hard (white walled) - slowest compound but lasts longest. As a rule, if a driver starts the race on softs, during their mandated pitstop they should change to the medium or hard compound. This is only applicable during a completely dry race so if it rain this is disregarded.\nFor wet tyres there are two compounds:\nIntermediates/Inters (green walled) - when there are a few showers of rain Full wets/ Extreme (blue walled) - when it\u0026rsquo;s really pouring on track. This tyre requires more water to cool it. The 2019 extremes cleared 65 litres of water per second at 300 kph. Flags # Flags are common in any motorsport and not just F1. The main flags used in F1 are:\nGreen: pretty obvious, race start or race resumes. Yellow: an accident or something has happened, drivers should slow down at the affected area as well as not overtake there Red: the session has been stopped. This occurs on safety grounds. Blue: waved to drivers about to be lapped to allow the leaders to pass them. Black: driver disqualified. Chequered flag: end of the session. Black and white: it is a warning to the driver waved at. Black and orange: waved to a driver who has car damage that could be unsafe and is required to pit to fix the issue. Also called the meat ball flag as it\u0026rsquo;s a round orange ball like the Japanese flag. Penalties # During a race, there are two main penalties that can be issued, a drive-through penalty or a time penalty. In a drive-through penalty, the driver has to drive through the pit lane (pit lane speed limit applies).\nFor a time penalty, the driver can have the \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; time penalty or a stop/go penalty. For a normal time penalty, if it\u0026rsquo;s 5 second, then the 5 seconds can be added at the end of the race or if they pit, they should remain stationary for 5 seconds before the pit crew can work on the car. For a stop/go penalty, the driver has to enter the pit lane, stop at their pit box to serve the time then exit without anybody working on the car.\nAnother type of penalty is a grid penalty which can be issued post or pre-race due to driver mistake or behaviour. So if after qualifying a driver is offered a 3-place grid penalty and they had qualified in P3, then they will start the race in P6. If the penalty is issued after a race then it will be in place at the next race.\nOther penalties exist such as engine penalties, fines and many more. The commentators will definitely fill you in.\nGlossary # DRS - Drag Reduction System - the rear wing opens up allowing air to pass through effectively reducing drag and giving the car a sort of \u0026ldquo;boost\u0026rdquo;. Source: Motorsport Images DNF - Did Not Finish - where a driver retires from a race or crashes out\nDNS - Did Not Start\nDSQ or DQ - Disqualified\n\u0026ldquo;Box this lap\u0026rdquo; - this is heard when a driver\u0026rsquo;s race engineer wants the driver to pit\n\u0026ldquo;Box opposite to\u0026rdquo; someone - the team tells their driver this to mean they should watch out on another driver, if the other driver pits they do not pit and vice versa\nFlat spot - when a driver locks up their tyre creating a part that is flat. That part continues to rub down during every braking resulting in vibrations and slower lap times. Halo - the half ring above a driver\u0026rsquo;s head. It serves to protect them.

Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to help - first of all it\u0026rsquo;s not cars going round in circles 😂.\nFormula 1 is a single seater form of open-wheeled racing and is considered the pinnacle of motorsport.\nBy open-wheeled I mean the drivers are not in a closed space like a normal car but are exposed to the elements. The sport is very exclusive to just the few drivers and not many people get the chance to experience the cars. Lets get to the nitty-gritty.\nPhoto by Carl Jorgensen on Unsplash\nTo start things off, I have section off things for easier reading.\nSeason Layout # The season usually starts in March but before them we have a couple of weeks where teams get to unveil their new car and also their new livery design. That is followed by winter testing where the teams get to test their car before the first race.\nRaces are spaced two weeks apart but some are one week apart. Mid-season there is a summer break in August before the final half resume until either end of November or early December.\nAfter the last race, there is post-season testing at the same location prior to going for the break. The cycle resumes the next year.\nRace Weekend Format # The structure of a normal race weekend is as follows:\nThur: Team Principal\u0026rsquo;s Press Conference Fri: Driver\u0026rsquo;s Press Conference, FP1 and FP2 Sat: FP3 and Qualifying Sun: Race FP is Free Practice, so on Friday there are two practice sessions where the teams and driver can set up their cars and get used to the track in preparation for the race. On Saturday, the team\u0026rsquo;s finalise the setup tweaks in practice before qualifying.\nQuali determines where a driver starts from on race day. It takes 1 hour and is broken into 3 timed sections: Q1, Q2 and Q3. Once the clock runs out in Q1, the bottom 5 drivers with the slowest lap times are eliminated and will start the race in that order, Q2 starts with 15 driver and ends with the top 10 who proceed for the final shootout in Q3. The driver who finishes with the best lap time come end of Q3 gets pole position and start from the front during the race.\nThe race itself last averagely around 90 minutes as drivers fight to stand on the podium after the race. Since the tracks differ in length, the number of laps is determined by the distance covered. The distance should sum up to about 305 km, except Monaco which is 260 km.\nFor a sprint weekend, qualifying will be on Friday (where FP2 would be) and will set the starting order for the sprint. FP2 is on Saturday and the Sprint where quali would typically be. The sprint is 100 km long with no mandatory stop and set the starting order the race.\nTeams and Drivers # Currently there are 10 teams/constructors with each having two drivers. There are customer teams and works teams who manufacture their own engines. It is common for teams to change engine manufacturer once their contract ends. Below is a list of the 2022 teams and their engines.\nFerrari powered: Ferrari, Alfa Romeo and Haas Mercedes powered: Mercedes, Aston Martin, Williams, McLaren Red Bull PowerTrains powered: Red Bull, Alpha Tauri Renault powered: Alpine For the current driver list or if you\u0026rsquo;re from the future and the teams have changed, visit the Formula 1 website.\nThere are two championships the World Drivers Championship (WDC) and the Constructors Championship. This is based on the points the drivers score over the whole season. For the constructors championship, the points of both drivers are added up to get the teams points.\nThe point systems is as follows, the winner receives 25 points, second place get 18 points followed by 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 and 1. So in short only the top 10 score points. Also, if any of those in top 10 get the fastest lap of the race, they get an extra point.\nDriver Market # The drivers can change teams once their contract ends or if another teams buys them out before their contract ends. A driver can have a one-year contract or a multi-year contract.\nMost of the teams usually confirm their driver lineup for the next year by mid-season. Red Bull are in a position where they can move a driver from their main team to the sister team if they deem it so. That\u0026rsquo;s all you need to know of the driver market.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s Part 1 done, click here for the final part.

European V8s have a high revving loud note while American V8s have low raw rumble.\nGreat examples are the C8 Corvette and the Ferrari 458 Italia. So why the sound difference? Exhaust systems definitely have an impact that even within the European cars you can distinguish a McLaren from a Ferrari.\nLinked at the end of article are two videos of the C8 Corvette and Ferrari 458 Spider\nThe difference lies in the type of crankshaft used, either flat-plane crank or cross-plane crank. Traditionally, flat-plane cranks have been used in four cylinder engines but European V8s use it while American V8s use the cross-plane crank.\nThe crankshaft is what is connected to the pistons via a connecting rod and the point of connection is called the crank journal. The positioning of the crank journals are what dictates the firing order of the engine and the type of crankshaft.\nFor a cross-plane crank, the crank journals are on two planes with a 90° angle between them thus from a frontal view the planes form a cross. In a flat-plane crank, as the name suggests the journals are flat on one plane separated by a 180° angle.\nRIGHT: CAD drawings of the different cranks LEFT: frontal view of crank with the cylinder that fires. So in a cross-plane crank, for every 90° rotation a cylinder fires and for a flat-plane crank, a cylinder fires after every 180° rotation.\nPicture a V8 with its two banks and cylinders numbered from 1 to 8, take one bank to have the even numbers and the other have the odd numbers. With that in mind, the firing order of the C8 Corvette is 1-8-7-2-6-5-4-3 and as you can see there are two even numbers (2-6) following each other meaning at some point two cylinders in one bank of the engine fire consecutively thus the firing order is uneven. This means the exhaust gases leaving the engine are also uneven resulting in a pulse that produces the rumble we know.\nIn flat-plane crank V8s, the firing order alternates between the two banks thus the exhaust gases are even which is effective in terms of the scavenging effect (explanation for another day). Due to the less resistance as an effect of even exhaust gases, the engine with flat-plane crank can rev to higher RPMs.\nAs we wrap it up, this is not to say that some American V8s don\u0026rsquo;t have flat-plane cranks or vice versa. It\u0026rsquo;s just that traditionally cross-plane crank is more common in American V8s whereas flat-plane is used predominantly and almost exclusively by European manufacturers.\nThe Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 uses a flat-plane crank and it can rev to 8200 RPM compared to 7000 RPM of the standard Mustang GT. Mercedes-AMG M156 6.2-liter V8 from the legendary SLS AMG uses a cross-plane crank.\nEach type of crank has their benefits and drawbacks but when it comes to engines its a matter of showing your engineering muscles and reducing the drawbacks.\nStill haven\u0026rsquo;t got it?
